# AutoPathComment (VS Code Extension)

- Purpose: On each file save, ensure a file-relative path comment is present at the top of the file using the correct single-line comment syntax; supports user overrides per extension.
- Tech stack: TypeScript, esbuild (CJS bundle), VS Code extension API.
- Entry: `src/extension.ts` â†’ builds to `dist/extension.js`.
- Tests: Mocha via `@vscode/test-cli` (integration-style, drives a VS Code instance), located in `src/test/*.test.ts`.
- Structure:
  - `src/extension.ts`: activation + logic; exports `getCommentSyntax` for tests.
  - `src/test/*.test.ts`: tests (compiled to `out/test`).
  - `dist/extension.js`: built output (generated by `esbuild.js`).
  - `.github/workflows/`: `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `release-please.yml`, etc.
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: maintained by Release Please.
- Node/VS Code: engines `^1.104.0`, CI uses Node 24.
